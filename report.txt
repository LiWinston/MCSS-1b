In this report, I delve into the intricacies of modeling concurrent programs, focusing particularly on the challenges posed by deadlock scenarios. I discovered that the initial version of the LTSA model led to a problem strikingly similar to that encountered in Assignment 1A, where the medical team at the triage desk, upon releasing orderlies, was instantly occupied by new patients entering the foyer. This resulted in the inability of the former to vacate their positions, while the other two groups remained trapped between the foyer and the triage desk, leading to deadlock.

Identifying the occurrence of deadlock necessitates satisfying the four necessary conditions known as the Coffman conditions. To circumvent these conditions, my solution overcame the "No preemption" constraint by allowing medical teams in transitional states between rooms to temporarily release the services of orderlies. For instance, in the scenario described earlier, the two groups caught between the foyer and the triage desk would attempt to release their orderlies, thereby allowing the patients otherwise facing deadlock in the triage desk to regain an opportunity to leave. As for the performance trade-off, while this solution may introduce idle opportunities at the model level, it can be seamlessly integrated at the implementation level without significantly increasing performance overheads. (Although I did not adopt another strategy in the modified model, which involves departing only when the next room is vacant, thus reducing system parallelism and increasing the turnaround time for each patient, it deviates from the original requirements and real-life scenarios—hospitals cannot prohibit people from passing through corridors simultaneously.)

A potential solution corresponding to this modified model (at the Java implementation level) involves maintaining a static priority queue for the orderlies class, containing all working nurses and their orderly allocations, with priority determined by their positions (the further back the position, the higher the priority, as it indicates proximity to discharge). On one hand, concurrent requests are granted from the head of the priority queue. On the other hand, when any nurse finds insufficient resources upon making a request, it traverses the queue backwards, seizes the orderlies of the lower-priority nurse, suspends their actions, and activates a callback coroutine. Once this nurse completes a transfer with the seized orderlies, they are immediately reallocated (returned) to the suspended nurse, allowing them to continue uninterrupted (achievable through a semaphore flag).

In conclusion, the crux of the problem lies in the hospital's inadequate capacity, necessitating either controlling concurrency intensity or compromising on processes—either by waiting excessively or by preempting actions. As the adages go, "you can't have your cake and eat it too" and "you can't have it both ways," these principles are applicable in this scenario as well.
